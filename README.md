(we actually wrote the README ourselves now)

HoneyHonk 1.3B is an AI chatbot powered by the GPT-NEO 1.3B model. it strikes a (nearly) perfect balance between the HoneyHonk Lite version and HoneyHonk.
Features:

Kinda smart

Kinda lightweight (if 5 gb is lightweight)

Privacy guaranteed (because it runs in cmd, and wipes its history when you close it, so no one can steal your data)

Requirements:
Python 3.8 (or more)
PyTorch
Transformers library
(you will install these later)

Installation:
1. Download the honeyhonk13b.py file
2. Install the required dependencies:
   
        pip install transformers torch
  
4. (Optional) Install CUDA for GPU support (cuz it runs faster on GPU)
   
5. Run HoneyHonk!

        python honeyhonk13b.py

FAQ's and troubleshooting:
doesnt work? try running with python3 instead of python:

    python3 honeyhonk13b.py

Says it cant find the file? copy the adress of where your file is and run it:

    python C:\users\gooseindustries\Desktop\HoneyHonk stuff\chatbot files\scripts\honeyhonk13b.py 

just replace that with the actual address for your file.
(and yes this is our actual address for the chatbots)

example conversation:

you: hello

HoneyHonk: wassup

you: i got u for free

HoneyHonk: the Goose Industries lawyers are on their way. (jk, im open source)
